hello!

so i've looked at my solutions from 2015-2019  
and i think i have cancer now from that awful code  
so i've decided to ~~quarantine those solutions over [here](https://github.com/SansPapyrus683/advent-of-code-pain)~~  

**UPDATE (12/11/23)**: i've now deleted all of that code outright so...

but hey, enjoy these solutions that are actually good (i hope)

### quick comments about certain languages

* **rust:** all the inputs are read from `../input` instead of straight `input`
  bc for some reason intellij can't build the project if i specify a different cwd(????)
* **go:** yeah, these also read from `../input` because of `go run .` and i'm too lazy to figure out how to run that main from another directory lol
* **haskell:** i gave up lmao probably won't ever finish 2019
* **python:** i think the only 3rd party packages i've used so far are numpy, sympy, and networkx, there's probably more but i forgor ðŸ’€
