uh really quick heads up here

for days 12, 23, and 25, the same assembly programming thing is used

now i could have been a good programmer and defined a single interpreter and called that from everywhere

but like 23 requires some weird optimization crap and 25 defines one more op that sucks

so i just copy pasted the code every single time :skull:

yeah, screw best practice
